 ## *Description*
 ### This is my week 18 challenge to build an API for a social network application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The challenge requires Express.js for routing, MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM. 

This webserver provides two databases users and thoughts for a social media application.  

- The 'users' routes listed below allow functionality to create, read, update, and delete users.  Additional user routes provide for adding and deleting friends to the respective user.  
- The 'thoughts' routes listed below allow functionality to create, read, update and delete a particular user's thoughts (e.g. posts). Additional thought routes provide users to add/delete their reactions (e.g. replies) to the original thought that was posted.
- Additionally, deleting a user will also delete all of their respective thoughts.  

Listed below are additional resources for the application:

 ## *Usage Information*
  After proper installation of the npm modules, use **"npm start"** To get the webserver up and running.  Port 3001 is the 'hardcoded port that will be served.  Use the following routes to manipulate the 'user' and 'thought' database:
  ```Create a user - POST api/users/
  Get all users - GET api/users/
  Get a user - GET api/users/:id
  Update a user - PUT api/users/:id
  Delete a user - DELETE api/users/:id
  Add a friend - PUT api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId
  Delete a friend - DELETE api/users/:userId/friends/:friendId

  Create a thought - POST api/thoughts/:userId
  Get all thoughts - GET api/thoughts/
  Get a thought by Id - GET api/thoughts/:thoughtId
  Update a thought - PUT api/thoughts/:thoughtId
  Delete a thought - DELETE api/thoughts/:thoughtId
  Add a reaction - POST api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:userId
  Delete a reaction - DELETE api/thoughts/:thoughtId/reactions/:reactionId
  ```
